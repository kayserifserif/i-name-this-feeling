# what i feel is

One-syllable emotions, felt in waves turbulent, uneven, overlapping, and without end.

The summer of 2020 has been a demanding one for many of the communities I belong to. The emotions have come unpredictably: sometimes it is blinkered life as normal, sometimes it is passionate grief and yearning.

This is a e-lit tool for writing emotion poems. It uses only monosyllabic words, which I find to be a useful limitation to curate words and produce a strong evocation, and which originally came out of my thoughts, one day, of "rage and rage and rage and rage". The poem will also always end with a trailing "and", reflecting that the latest emotion word—whatever we're feeling now—doesn't last, that there is wistful beauty in the transiently genuine emotion of the moment, in our struggles right now, internal and external, petty and important.
