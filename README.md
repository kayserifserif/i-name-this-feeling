## Development

This is a Node.js/Express app using EJS as the templating engine. It also interfaces with a Supabase database — to get that running, make a copy of `.env.example`, rename it `.env`, and add the API key from the Supabase project key.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site is hosted on render.com.

The server and the database are both slow on free plans — note to self to check periodically that the project hasn't been paused.
